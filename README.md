## Introduction

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
I'm in the process of building my first Cube so directions will probably change as I figure things out.

This documents my journey building the MGN BLV 3D Printer designed and graciously contributed to the world by Ben Levi. My goal is to provide a guide that others can follow to build their own cubes. This guide, at least initally, will provide instructions for my specific build as detailed below. If your configuration is different keep that in mind when following the directions.

### My Build Specifications
* Standard 365mm Build Height Frame (The one listed on BLV's site)
* BLTouch ABL Probe
* SKR v1.3 Controller with TFT35 LCD


## Printed parts
* Original Parts are in the /parts/source folder
* Modified Parts are in the /parts/remixed folder (This also includes individual STLs)

I got much help by watching [Fugatech3D's live stream on his build](https://www.youtube.com/user/fuganater987)

Also the documentation and style modifications we're greatly inspired by [Greg Saun's Work](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis/blob/master/README.md)
