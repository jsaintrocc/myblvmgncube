## Disclaimer
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

I'm in the process of building my first Cube so directions will probably change as I figure things out. Definitely consult other sources and double check what I'm saying at ever step.

## Introduction
This documents my journey building the MGN BLV 3D Printer designed and graciously contributed to the world by Ben Levi. My goal is to provide a guide that others can follow to build their own cubes. This guide, at least initally, will provide instructions for my specific build as detailed below. If your configuration is different keep that in mind when following the directions.

### My Build Specifications
* Standard 365mm build height frame (The one listed on BLV's site)
* BLTouch ABL probe
* SKR v1.4 controller
* TMC2208 stepper drivers
* TFT35 LCD touch screen


## Printed Parts
Parts are located in the following directories

* Original Parts: [/parts/source/](parts/source)
* Remixed Parts: [/parts/remixed/](parts/remixed) *working on separating out original step files right now*
* Community Parts: [/parts/extra/](parts/extra) *improved parts from community members that are I used*

I got much help by watching [Fugatech3D's live stream on his build](https://www.youtube.com/user/fuganater987)

Also the documentation and style modifications we're greatly inspired by [Greg Saun's Work](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis/blob/master/README.md)
