# Instructing for printing the parts

## Extruder
Generally Ben has recommended 90% infill and 3 shells.  That seems excessive to me.  I'm going with the trusty Prusa recommended 20% infill and 3 sheels.  4 tops layers 3 bottom layers

## Specific Parts Notes
### X_carriage_-_V6_locker_IR_mini.stl
* Orientation is upside down so reorient with largest surface on build plate
* Probably need supports for this one.
  Extra perimiters/detect briding perimiters/40% overhang thresh
* I printed in ABS/Black would probably consider PETG
  I used a enclosed build environment to prevent warping.

### X_carriage_-_Rear_plate.stl
* Use support from build plate only (should support that steep overhang)
