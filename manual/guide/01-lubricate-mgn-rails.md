## Prep

1. Put some simple green into the mason jar
2. tape the magnets to the bottom of your plastic container
3. Put a paper towel in the bottom of the container
4. Put the simple green jar into the container

## Procedure

1. Put some simple green into the mason jar
1. remove plug from one end of rail, i popped it out with a small allen key on the other side of the rail
1. Carefully slide carriage off of rail (Over plastic dish)
1. Set aside carriage for a minute
1. De-grease rail
   1. Put some simple green on a paper towel and wipe down the rail
   2. using your fingernail on the paper towel run down the grooves
   3. now using alcohol on a paper towel do the same process to remove the simple green
   4. Use spray air to quickly dry the alcohol
   5. Spray the rail with silicone lubricant and wipe off excess
   6. set aside to dry
1. Now go back to the carriage
1. Remove red seal with micro driver and philips bit PZ00 and put in simple green jar
1. Carefully remove wire retainers (Note ball bearings will now fall out) briefly rinse in simple green and then put on paper towel
   Note: there are 66 bearing per carriage 33 per side (But it's not really going to matter)
1. Rinse wires in jar of alcohol and set aside
1. Remove green plugs gently (There are too parts to each green plug make sure to separate them) put in simple green jar
1. Carefully remove any remaining bearings and set aside (Maybe they're good? In any case can probably use them as spares)
1. Agitate the jar, carefully, for about 30 min. Careful because the blocks could damage the plastic parts.
1. Next part is messy so may want to do this in a sink (Remember to plug the drain though)
1. Remove each piece and dry with a paper towel and the spray air
1. place each piece in jar of alcohol and agitate
1. Once all parts are in alcohol slowly remove each part and dry with paper towel and blow with spray air
1. Inspect to make sure no water remains. Especially in bearing channels. 
1. Load syringe with Super lube and fill each bearing return tube
1. Using tweesers pick a ball bearing up and place on open channel balanced on retaining wire.
1. Push in with finger
1. Now using tweesers push bearing into bearing return one at a time. This will get tough as the grease will be pushed out the other end.
1. You've loaded all 33 bearings when there is one space left. 
2. Put the carriage back on the rail and use some zip ties through the mounting holes to keep it from sliding off.
