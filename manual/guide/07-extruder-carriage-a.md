2. partially insert the M3 18mm into the pulley holder
3. slowly add the washer->bearing->washer->bearing->washer into the pulley holder advancing the M3 as you go. You can use some blue tape as a helper. It's a pain. take your time and go slowly.
4. Screw down the M3. Don't worry if it starts splipping. the tensioner body will keep it in place
5. insert the pulley holder into the tensioner body
6. now insert the M4 nut into the adjustment knob and screw onto the end of the m4 bolt. once it bites give it 5 turns.
7. repeat for the other side
