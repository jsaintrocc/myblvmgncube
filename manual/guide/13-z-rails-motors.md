# My BLV MGN Cube - Step 13 Z Rails and Motors

## [Step 13 BoM Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTVx7BvB3V7CozF2l4eWkNntWrHSjOawmrsi_bRSVxQLIGVlfZTYEGp8a6fHpENV6hV2cn9PrDLHHl0/pubhtml?gid=1231889643&single=true)

### Prep
1. Attach 8x M3 8mm socket head cap screws and T-Nuts into every other hole of the 2 linear rails. Leave a open hole at the top of each rail.

2. File down the Z rail stoppers and Z motor mounts so that the T-Nuts will have enough space to grab the extrusion.

### Assembly

1. Attach the left linear rail to the 442mm Z extrusion. Use the 2x 2020 jigs to center the rail on the extrusion and tighten in the pattern indicated. Make sure there isn't a gap between the linear rail and the top Z rail stopper.
